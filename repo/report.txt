Audit Report for Mobile Game App

1. Executive Summary
- App Overview: React Native (Expo), Supabase backend, Zustand state management.
- Key Findings:
  * Performance: Large JS bundle, unoptimized assets, redundant network calls.
  * Scalability: Potential DB connection surge with 200 concurrent users.
  * Security: Supabase anon key committed, missing RLS policies.

2. Application Architecture & Workflow
- File Structure:
  * app/: entry point and navigation pages.
  * components/: reusable UI components.
  * lib/supabase/: Supabase client wrappers and provider.
  * lib/store/: Zustand store and hooks.
  * assets/: static images and data.
  * scripts/: DB setup and debug scripts.
- Data Flow: App.tsx → SupabaseProvider (session) → useStore hydrates user data → UI renders startup list, leaderboard → user interactions via investment or negotiation RPCs → state updates → re-render.

3. Performance Audit
 a. Initial Load:
  - JS bundle size: measure with expo-bundle-size; target <2MB gzipped.
  - Time to Interactive (TTI): measure on mid-tier device; aim for <3s.
  - Recommendations: enable Hermes, remove unused dependencies, use babel-plugin-transform-remove-console, implement code-splitting and lazy loading.
 b. Asset Management:
  - Optimize images: compress to WebP/AVIF; resize for device resolution.
  - Preload critical assets via Asset.loadAsync; use expo-asset caching.
 c. UI Rendering:
  - Use FlatList/SectionList virtualization for large lists.
  - Memoize components with React.memo; use useCallback for handlers.
 d. Network & Data:
  - Batch parallel queries with Promise.all.
  - Debounce real-time updates; implement pagination and infinite scroll for large datasets.

4. Scalability & Backend
- Connection Pooling: integrate PgBouncer or Supabase connection pooling.
- Edge Functions: migrate heavy business logic to Supabase Edge Functions.
- Caching: implement in-memory caching or use a CDN for static data and responses.

5. Security Audit
- Key Management: move supabase keys to environment variables; secure with expo-constants or react-native-dotenv.
- Authorization: enable Row-Level Security (RLS) on all tables; define strict policies based on auth.uid.
- Input Validation: sanitize and validate all client inputs before RPC calls.
- Transport: enforce HTTPS; configure CORS to restrict origins.
- Monitoring: integrate Sentry for error tracking; log key events like auth failures and RPC errors.

6. Recommendations Summary
- Performance: use Hermes, lazy loading, image compression, memoization.
- Scalability: connection pooling, Edge Functions, caching.
- Security: env variables, RLS policies, input validation, TLS.
- Developer Workflow: CI/CD with automated linting, tests (Jest for unit, Detox for E2E), performance benchmarking.

7. Next Steps
- Conduct load tests with 200 simulated users (e.g. Artillery).
- Audit RLS policies and database indices for query performance.
- Refactor codebase for tree-shaking and lazy loading of modules.
- Establish periodic security and performance reviews.
