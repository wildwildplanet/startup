# Startup Pitch Challenge App – Final Audit Report

**Audit Date:** 2025-04-20

---

## Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive audit of the "Startup Pitch Challenge" app in preparation for public deployment (targeting 200+ concurrent users). The audit covers performance, security, code quality, dependency health, Expo/EAS deployment readiness, and final deployment steps. Key issues and recommendations are highlighted.

---

## 1. Performance Audit
- **App Structure:** Modular React Native/Expo codebase with separation of concerns (tabs, modals, components).
- **State Management:** Uses Zustand for efficient local state. No unnecessary global state detected.
- **Database Calls:** Uses Supabase; portfolio fetching and investment logic are efficient but could be further optimized for large user bases (pagination, selective fetching).
- **Async Operations:** All critical DB/network operations are async. No blocking UI operations detected.
- **Startup Time:** Splash and icon assets are optimized; Hermes JS engine enabled for better runtime performance.
- **Potential Bottlenecks:**
  - Rendering large lists (e.g. FlatList in portfolio) could cause slowdowns if user investment count grows; consider lazy loading/pagination if needed.
  - Some third-party charting libraries (react-native-chart-kit, victory) are not optimized for large datasets or new React Native architecture.

## 2. Security Audit
- **Authentication:** Uses Supabase Auth; sessions are securely stored using AsyncStorage.
- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Enabled on Supabase for investments and user_profiles.
- **Environment Variables:** .env files not found in repo—ensure all secrets are managed via EAS secrets or CI/CD, never committed to source.
- **Sensitive Data:** No sensitive user data is exposed in logs or UI. Console logs should be stripped from production using `babel-plugin-transform-remove-console`.
- **API Keys:** All API keys are referenced via environment variables. Double-check EAS/Expo secrets config before deployment.
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** No known vulnerabilities after `expo install --check` and `npm audit`.

## 3. Code Quality & Dependency Audit
- **TypeScript:** Type errors detected:
  - `App.tsx`: Variable 'fontPromises' implicitly has type 'any[]'.
  - `components/Investments/NegotiationModal.tsx`: Duplicate object keys.
  - `lib/store/useStore.ts`: Reference to missing 'updateUserBalance'.
  - **Recommendation:** Fix all TypeScript errors before release.
- **Dependencies:**
  - All core dependencies are compatible with Expo SDK 52 after update.
  - Some libraries (react-native-chart-kit, victory) are unmaintained/untested on new architecture. Consider alternatives for future-proofing.
  - Remove `@types/react-native` from devDependencies (types included in react-native).
- **Expo Config:** `app.json` is correctly configured for icons, splash, orientation, and Hermes engine.
- **EAS Config:** No `eas.json` found. Recommend initializing with `eas build:configure` for cloud builds.

## 4. Deployment Readiness & Steps
- **Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
  1. **Fix all TypeScript errors** (see above).
  2. **Remove console logs** from production builds.
  3. **Ensure all environment variables** (Supabase keys, etc.) are set in EAS secrets or CI/CD.
  4. **Test on physical devices** (iOS/Android) using Expo Go and EAS preview builds.
  5. **Initialize EAS Build:**
     ```bash
     npx eas build:configure
     # Set up iOS/Android credentials and secrets as prompted
     ```
  6. **Build for Production:**
     ```bash
     npx eas build --platform all
     # Or separately: --platform ios / --platform android
     ```
  7. **Submit to App Stores:**
     ```bash
     npx eas submit --platform ios
     npx eas submit --platform android
     ```
  8. **Monitor Supabase Usage:**
     - Set up Supabase usage alerts and monitor for rate limits or spikes.
     - Consider upgrading Supabase plan if needed for 200+ concurrent users.

## 5. Security & Scaling Recommendations
- **Enable rate limiting** on Supabase endpoints if possible.
- **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity (failed logins, abuse).
- **Test with simulated load** (e.g. using Artillery, k6, or similar tools) to ensure Supabase and app can handle 200+ users.
- **Review Supabase RLS policies** for all tables.
- **Set up error monitoring** (Sentry, Bugsnag, etc.) for runtime issues in production.

## 6. Remarks & Final Notes
- The app is well-structured and close to production-ready.
- Address all TypeScript and dependency warnings before final build.
- Consider replacing unmaintained charting libraries for long-term support.
- Add `eas.json` for EAS build automation.
- Ensure all secrets are managed securely.
- Test the onboarding and investment flows end-to-end on both iOS and Android before launch.
